### Preferences

<details>
<summary>
I enjoy working with a lot of different technologies, but my current preferred tech is...
</summary>

 - **Programming Language**: Go _("golang", for the SEO)_
 - **Operating System**:
     - **"Desktop"**: Windows with Ubuntu running in WSL
     - **"Mobile"**: Android
 - **Operating Environment**: Terminal/CLI
 - **Text/Code Editor**: Vim
 - **Framework**:
     - **Backend**: None. I'd rather compose independent libraries in Go, and largely just use the standard library.
     - **CLI**: [lieut](https://github.com/Rican7/lieut)
         - It's tiny and only uses the standard library.
         - Yeaaaaa, I made it... ðŸ˜…
     - **Frontend**: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

### Newest Project

#### Introducing ["lieut"](https://github.com/Rican7/lieut)

Lieut, short for lieutenant, or "second-in-command" to a commander.

An opinionated, feature-limited, no external dependency, "micro-framework" for building command line applications in Go.
